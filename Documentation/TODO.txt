WHAT ARE COMMITTEES
Student COMMITTEES? - Is this just projects? Did I make COMMITTEES but wrong? No. Projects are always one-shot. 
Thanksgiving COMMITTEE makes more sense as a project instead of being part of spirit COMMITTEE (they are loosly connected).
Halloween makes more sense under spirit COMMITTEE. (does it though?)
Does Dance make more sense as a project? Possibly? I don't see its purpose as a COMMITTEE. It's not like there's much of a differnece, just that COMMITTEE have staying power. 
Park is obviously a project. 
Senate COMMITTEE? 
Comitie suggestion?
A page for every COMMITTEE? 
Definitly a COMMITTEE model. 
Do Commities need surveys? 
Should there be a survey to figure out what I need in COMMITTEES? Probably.
